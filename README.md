# FactorInvesting
As an intern in a public offering fund, I am exploring factor investing strategy. I will put resources I find useful/interesting and the code I will be doing for individual projects.  

The main "textbooks" are :  [Factor Investing]( https://www.factorwar.com//) by Dr. Chuan Shi, Dr. Yangyi Liu and Mr. Xiangbin Lian (Chinese Version only) and *Inside the Black Box: A Simple Guide to Quantitative and High-frequency trading* by Rishi K. Narang.
