It‘s been a while :)
To keep myself on track, I decided to write down what I have done in a day in this log, and some troubles I find along the way.

## 25/07/22
+ The first topic is about Volume-Price factor （随手翻译）
+ Played around with the notebook and tried to redo it on Jupyter notebook.
+ Stucked on the package directory (Have been troubled by this issue since 2018 lol)
+ Found out that certain libraries are only avilable on uqer, so I might not be able to share my code on github.
+ I will code on uqer and then find some alternatives packages & data sources to display on jupyter notebook (when I have time).

## 26/07/22
+ Actually I started with BET factor which is defined by \frac{ln(1+r * P/E)}{ln(1+r)},   where r is the expected growth rate of net profit, and P/E is the Price-to-Earnings ratio of a stock. The main idea is to pick up stocks with high value and high growth potential at the same time. 
+ 1/3 BET code finished, stucked on a non-existing DataAPI to get r. Therefore a critical task for tomorrow is to get resonable data and clean them.
+ Cloned Volume-Price factor notebook and will have a look at it.
