It‘s been a while :)
To keep myself on track, I decided to write down what I have done in a day in this log, and some troubles I find along the way.

## 25/07/22
+ The first topic is about Volume-Price factor （随手翻译）
+ Played around with the notebook and tried to redo it on Jupyter notebook.
+ Stucked on the package directory (Have been troubled by this issue since 2018 lol)
+ Found out that certain libraries are only avilable on uqer, so I might not be able to share my code on github.
+ I will code on uqer and then find some alternatives packages & data sources to display on jupyter notebook (when I have time).
