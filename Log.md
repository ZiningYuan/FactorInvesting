Itâ€˜s been a while :)
To keep myself on track, I decided to write down what I have done in a day in this log, and some troubles I find along the way.

## 25/07/22
+ The first topic is Volume-Price factor
+ Played around with the notebook and tried to redo it on Jupyter notebook.
+ Stucked on the package directory (Have been troubled by this issue since 2018 lol)
+ Found out that certain libraries are only avilable on uqer.
+ Decdied to code on uqer first, and then I will find some alternatives packages & data sources (when I have time).
